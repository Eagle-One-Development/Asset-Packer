# Asset-Packer
A program that cleans up and packs VPKs and their assets for maps.

Current Features:
* Packing using the vmap and compiled vpk
* 3D Skybox map and asset detection
* Materials, textures, particles and Models are detected and packed
* Crashes s&box if it's running during packing :)
* Broken size on some display scales

(Sounds are not currently supported, but we'll work on it soon!)

How to Use:
* Compile your map.
* Make sure your vmap and compiled vpk are in the same directory.
* Select your vmap, asset directory and sbox directory in the boxes above.
* Click pack. The found and packed assets will be listed below.

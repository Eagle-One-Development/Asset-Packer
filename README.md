# Asset-Packer

A program that packs or isolates compiled assets used in a Map.

# Current Features:

* Packing using the vmap and compiled vpk
* 3D Skybox and prefab asset detection
* Materials, textures, particles, post processing and Models are detected and packed
* Proper support for legacy imported Models
* Crashes s&box if it's running during packing :)

# How to Use:

1. Compile your map.
2. Make sure your vmap and compiled vpk are in the same directory.
3. Select your vmap, asset directory and sbox directory in the boxes above.
4. Click pack. The found and packed assets will be listed below.

In case you don't want to have your content packed, just check the box and it will instead appear in a folder called yourMap_content.

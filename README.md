# Asset-Packer

A program that cleans up and packs VPKs and their assets for maps.

# Current Features:

2. Make sure your vmap and compiled vpk are in the same directory.
3. Select your vmap, asset directory and sbox directory in the boxes above.
4. Click pack. The found and packed assets will be listed below.
